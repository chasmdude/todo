# Secfix TODOs Application

Purpose of the application is to expose endpoints for managing the To-do tasks of organization employees (aka User(s) on this application).

The application gives the possibility to the user to define Github repositories records (through the `/code-repository` endpoints) and then link them to Tasks.

A cron job (`CodeRepositoriesSyncCronJob.java` class) is running every hour and syncs data (e.g. url, open issues count, stars count) about the Github repositories.

**Notes**

- If a Github repository is not found when calling the Github api, its status is changed to `INVALID`.
- Users can use only link tasks to code repositories whose status = `ACTIVE`.
- At the moment the application is open to the public, there is no authentication/ authorization

**Exposes endpoints for managing:**

- Users
  - Get users
  - Get a user by id
  - Create user
  - Update user
  - Delete user
- Tasks
  - Get tasks
  - Get a task by id

  - Delete task
- Code Repositories
  - Get code respositories
  - Get a repository by id

  - Update repository (name, owner, status)
  - Delete repository. (hard deletes the repository)
